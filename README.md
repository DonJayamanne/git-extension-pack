# Git Extension Pack

This extension pack packages some of the most popular (and some of my favorite) Git extensions.

## Extensions Included

* [Git History (git log)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory) - View git log, file or line history.

* [gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore) - Language support for .gitignore files. Lets you pull .gitignore files from the https://github.com/github/gitignore repository.
